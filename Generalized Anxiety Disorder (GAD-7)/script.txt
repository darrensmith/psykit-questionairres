The GAD-7 is a short test that checks symptoms and can be used assess the severity of generalized anxiety.

This test is in no way a replacement of clinical diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder.
The possible scores on the GAD-7 run from 0 to 21.

In the study by Spitzer et al. (2006), more than 2000 patients in primary care settings participated. Of the patients who were known to suffer from generalized anxiety disorder, the average GAD-7 score was 14.4. Of the patients that were known not to suffer from the disorder, the GAD-7 score was 4.9.

According to the paper, people with a score of 10 or greater might suffer from generlized anxiety disorder.
Women suffer considerably more from generalized anxiety disorder than men.
