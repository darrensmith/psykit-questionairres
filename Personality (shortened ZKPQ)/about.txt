Introduction
============

There are different ways to capture the personality traits that differ most between people. The BIG5 approach is one of them. The Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire follows a different approach (click here for a Wikipedia description of the differences between the approaches). See also the Zuckerman et al. paper, 1993 for a comparison of the different models of personality.

The shortened version of the ZKPQ (50 items) has been validated (Aluja et al., 2006), and you can find the original article and further information here.

Unlike the Big 5 questionnaires, which uses a Likert scale, the ZKPQ asks participants to score items as True or False.
The ZKPQ distinguishes the following 5 personality factors (abbreviation in parentheses):

Impulsive Sensation Seeking (ImpSS)

Neuroticism-Anxiety (N-Anx)

Aggression-Hostility (Agg-Host)

Activity (Act)

Sociability (Sy)
