Introduction
============

Problematic internet use is a common phenomenon. The Problematic Internet Use Questionnaire (PIUQ) was first published in 2006 and its psychometric properties were checked in a study by Kelly & Gruber (2010). The latter study generally confirmed the three-factor structure.

The three factors underlying the PIUQ are:

Obsession — being obsessed with Internet activities

Neglect — neglecting non-internet activities

Control disorder — unable stopping to use the internet

See also the PsyToolkit implementation of the Facebook addiction scale.
The participants in the original PIUQ study (carried out in Budapest, Hungary) were (approximately) for 50% students, and the mean age was 23 years. The age of participants ranged from 12 to 69.

The PIUQ does not give any cut-off points (for when Internet use becomes of concern) because it did not study a clinical population.
