q: The measure can be used to derive an overall affect balance score, but
can also be divided into positive and negative feelings
scales.<BR><BR>Positive Feelings (SPANE-P): Add the scores, varying
from 1 to 5, for the six items: positive, good, pleasant, happy,
joyful, and contented. The score can vary from 6 (lowest possible) to
30 (highest positive feelings score). Midpoint is thus 18. Your score is
{$SPANE_P}.<BR><BR>
Negative Feelings (SPANE-N): Add the scores,
varying from 1 to 5, for the six items: negative, bad, unpleasant,
sad, afraid, and angry. The score can vary from 6 (lowest possible) to
30 (highest negative feelings score). Midpoint is thus 18. Your score is
{$SPANE_N}.<BR><BR>
Affect Balance (SPANE-B): The negative feelings
score is subtracted from the positive feelings score, and the
resultant difference score can vary from -24 (unhappiest possible) to
24 (highest affect balance possible).<br><br>
A respondent with a very high score of 24 reports that she or he
rarely or never experiences any of the negative feelings, and very
often or always has all of the positive feelings. Your score is
{$SPANE_B}<BR><BR>
