Introduction
Eating disorders are a major problem, especially in young women. Common types of eating disorders are:

Anorexia nervosa: Trying to keep weight excessive low through self-starvation, etc.

Bulimia: Overeating followed by throwing up or use of laxative

Binge eating: Feeling an urge to overeat

There is a lot of information that can easily be found on the internet, including self-help information.

The Clinical Impairment Assessment (CIA) Questionnaire was created by the Credo group in Oxford. The CIA focuses on the impact an eating disorder has on psychosocial functioning, that is, on general wellbeing and the ability to have meaningful friendships.

There are 16 Likert items, and the total CIA possible score ranges from 0 to 48. Higher scores indicate higher levels of psychosocial impairment associated with an eating disorder.

The original study by Bohn et al. (2008) was carried out with 123 patients who participated in a cognitive behavioral therapy in eating disorder clinics. These were the CIA scores of patients no longer suffering from an eating disorder compared to those still suffering from an eating disorder.

Group															Score
Patients no longer considered to have an eating disorder 		7.86
Patients who were still have an eating disorder 				27.64

A score of 16 or higher might indicate an eating disorder case (Bohn et al., 2008).
