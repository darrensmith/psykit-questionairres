An article about the SMD on the popular psychology website Psychology Today
Social Media includes any website where messages are posted for a group of people. This includes Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, and the many other social media websites there are.

The SMD consists of 9 yes/no questions about feelings about social media.

According to the paper by van der Eijnden and colleagues, if you answer 5 or more of the questions with yes, you have a social media disorder.

In the study by van der Eijnden and colleagues with more than a 1000 adolescents (aged 10-17 years old) in The Netherlands, it was found that between 7% and 12% met the criteria of social media disorder.
