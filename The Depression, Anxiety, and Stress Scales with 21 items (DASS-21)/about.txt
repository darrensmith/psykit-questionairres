Introduction
============

For a full description/interpretation see the DASS. This is simply a shorter version.

The "normal" DASS has 42 questions. In order to have comparible scores, the sum of the DASS-21 is multiplied by 2. For the score interpretation, see the DASS description.

In the original DASS-21, the abbreviation "eg" is used for "for example". In this PsyToolkit version, "for example" is used, because not everybody might now the abbreviation "eg" (which is predominantly used in academia).
