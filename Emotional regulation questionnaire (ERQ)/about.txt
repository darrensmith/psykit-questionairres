Introduction
============

Emotion is a core component of human psychology, and is strongly related to physiological responses as well (video about this here).

Humans do not only experience emotions, but we can also manage them; this ability is called emotional regulation. A daily life example is getting angry at something, then realizing that the angry response is not appropriate and trying to change the emotion.

Interview with Professor Gross, one of the top researchers in the study of emotional regulation. Watch video.
The degree to which people vary in how they regulate their emotions can be measured with the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. The paper this appeared in (Gross & John, 2003) is highly cited.

This is a 10 item scale which taps into two emotion regulation strategies, namely

Cognitive reappraisal (of emotions)

Expressive suppression (of emotions)

The scoring takes the average of all the scores (i.e., the score lies between 1 and 7). The table below shows the averages of 1483 undergraduate students around 20 years of age.

Score on								Men		Women
Cognitive reappraisal					4.60	4.61
Expressive suppression					3.64	3.14

Men suppress emotions more than women.
