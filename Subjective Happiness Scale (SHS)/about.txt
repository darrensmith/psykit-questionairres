Happiness and the term more commonly used in psychology, subjective wellbeing, are frequently studied in the field of psychology (including in positive psychology) and related applied areas, such as social care.

There are a number of measures of subjective well-being (see also the childrenâ€™s happiness scale here in the survey library).
