Introduction
============

Procrastination is the postponing of more important activities for less important ones.

On the internet, you can also find many self-help videos on how to overcome procrastination, such as this one.
In the above video, the following two reasons for procrastination are given:

People rather self-handicap. That means, they do not give 100% of their effort to reach a goal (e.g., doing well in an exam). This then creates the opportunity of an excuse. For example, they then can say "I did fail my exam because I did not work hard enough". In essence, the underlying motivation of self-handicapping is an anxiety for failure.

Lack of organisation. It is just hard to organise your life. You need schedules and lists and you need to write out what you need to.

The average score among students is around 9.4 points (Lay, 1986, p.477).
