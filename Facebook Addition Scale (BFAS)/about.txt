Introduction
============

Facebook addiction is a specific form of Internet addiction in which a person is addicted to checking Facebook. Anyone travelling on public transportation can observe this phenomenon.

The Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale is a very short questionnaire which can help to find out if you suffer from this. The scale was developed with a student sample at the University of Bergen in Norway.

According to the paper, there are two possible ways of determining whether someone is suffering from signs of Facebook addiction:
Liberal judgement: Someone with at least 4 out of the 6 items scored as "sometimes (3)" or more often.
Conservative judgement: Someone with all 6 out of the 6 items scored as "sometimes (3)" or more often.
