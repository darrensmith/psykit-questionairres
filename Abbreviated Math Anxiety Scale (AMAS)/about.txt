Introduction
============

Mathematics anxiety is a negative emotion associated to mathematics related activities, such as mathematics homework. Mathematics anxiety is related to poorer mathematics performance.

The subject mathematics anxiety has been studied since the work of Richardson and Suinn in the early 1970s. There is still a growing number of publications about the subject.

There are many self-help videos about mathematics anxiety on YouTube. Click here to see a list of them.
The Abbreviated Math Anxiety Scale by Hopko and colleagues, 2003 is a popular and psychometrically validated measure of mathematics anxiety.

Interesting fact: In American English, people say "math" and in British English people say "maths". A way around this is just using the word "mathematics", as has been chosen for the PsyToolkit demonstration.
The study by Hopko and colleagues, 2003 studied more than a thousand undergraduate students. In the primary sample (N=206), the average scores were as follows (data from p.180 of the Hopko et al. paper):

Group	Score (possible values 9 to 45)
All     21.1
Men     19.5
Women   21.9

In this study, women scored higher than men. That is a well known effect also found in other studies of mathematics anxiety.
