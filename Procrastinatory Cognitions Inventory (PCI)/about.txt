Introduction
============

Procrastination is the postponing of more important activities for less important ones.

The Procrastinatory Cognitions Inventory (PCI) thoughts associated with procrastination. The higher one scores on the PCI, the more mostly negative thoughts associated with procrastinations occur, such as "Why canâ€™t I just get started?".

The PCI has 18 items, each scored between 0 (not at all) and 4 (all the time), thus the summed score on this scale runs from 0 to 72. Students in the study by Stainton et al. (2000) scored on average around 29 points.

The second author is the creator of the original procrastination trait scale, which is also available in this PsyToolkit library.
