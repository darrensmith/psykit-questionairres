Introduction
============

Autism is a mental health condition which is frequently mentioned in the media. No wonder, given that more and more children and adults are diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum. Therefore, it is important to have a short checklist which may be a reason to go see a mental health specialist. The Short Autism Spectrum Quotient is exactly made to be that, and it has been developed by the same team that developed the longer and most used Autism Quotient Scale (under the supervision of Simon Baron-Cohen at Cambridge University in the UK).

Note that this and all other tests from the Autism Research Centre in the UK are freely available via their website: https://www.autismresearchcentre.com/

A score of 6 points or higher suggests (according to the description on the scale) that you may consider specialist diagnostic assessment. Warning: This is not a diagnostic tool! Normally, this test is only used in a healthcare setting and when people come to a doctor with problems, the doctor may use this test as a "red flag" tool to help them making a decision for sending people for further checks. Thus, if you just do this test on a rainy afternoon or as part of your study without any further concerns, you are not belonging to the group of people for whom this test is made.
