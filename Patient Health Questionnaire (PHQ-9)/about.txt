Introduction
============

There is a variety of rating scales for symptoms of depression, and the 9-item Person Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is one of them.

The PHQ-9 article below is highly cited (more than 3600 citations as of May 2015).
The advantages of the PHQ-9 are:

It is a methodologically good scale (check the article)

It takes very little time to fill in, only 9 short questions

It can be used without paying a publisher/company, as is the case with the well known Beck depression inventory (BDI)

Like the CUDOS, the PHQ-9 can be used to indicate the severity of depression. The authors write:

PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively.
