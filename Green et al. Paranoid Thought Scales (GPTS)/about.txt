Introduction
Paranoia is a way of irrational thinking in which a person thinks that others are trying to "get him" or her. Because of this a person suffering from paranoia might make false accusations against other people. Paranoia is a common symptom of psychosis, which is a psychiatric term for a person’s irrational interpretation of reality.

Daniel Freeman’s 2007 review article about paranoia gives an excellent overview of the topic.
Ten to fifteen percent of the population experiences paranoid thoughts regularly (Freeman, 2007).

The Green et al. Paranoid Thought Scales (GPTS) measures 2 dimensions of paranoid thinking:

Ideas of social reference: "The person holds the belief that some neutral event has special personal significance/refers to them personally by means of observation or communication by another." (Startup & Startup, 2005). For example "I often heard people referring to me"

Ideas of social persecution: For example "People have intended me harm"

The mean sample scores are from Table 3 of the Green et al. (2008) paper. The averages are based on 353 people without known mental health issues and 50 people with persecutory delusions.

Did you know that there is a literary genre called paranoid fiction? Read more about it here.
