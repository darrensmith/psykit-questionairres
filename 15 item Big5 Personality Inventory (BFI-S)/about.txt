Introduction
============

The BIG 5 is one of the leading models to express the most important dimensions of personality, namely:

Openness,

Conscientiousness,

Extraversion,

Agreeableness,

Neuroticism (also known as emotional instability)

You can remember these easily as OCEAN (the first letter of each trait).

Typically, questionnaires measuring BIG 5 dimenionsions can take some time, but there are short ones that are reasonably reliable (depending on what you need it for, etc, check the references).
